Once upon a time, in a far-off future where self-driving cars had been replaced by self-driving sandwiches, Professor Quibblefizz accidentally invented a time machine out of a toaster and a bag of pretzels. His plan was simple: toast bread with a side of nostalgia. Instead, he found himself whisked away to the 21st century, where people still used actual toasters and thought pretzels were just a snack. As he landed in the middle of a traffic jam, his time-traveling toaster sputtered out a confused pop, and he was greeted by a bewildered commuter who mistook him for a new kind of vending machine. Thus began Professor Quibblefizz’s most bizarre adventure yet: trying to fit in with a world that had a lot less butter and a lot more questions about who—or what—he was.
In the year 3094, humanity had evolved into a race of sentient robots with a fondness for interstellar gardening. The sky was no longer blue but a shimmering holographic canvas that changed colors based on the collective mood of the planet. Professor Quibblefizz, now a revered historian, was seen as a relic from a time when people still worried about things like "traffic jams" and "toasters."
